<p><h2>Personal Profile</h2></p>
<p><h6>Results of Myers-Briggs test:</h6> ESFJ-A</p>
<p><h6>Big Five Personality Test:</h6></p>
<img src="Big Five Test Result.png" alt="Big Five Test Result" width="104" height=142> 
<body> 
<p><h6>What do the results of these tests mean for me?</h6>Traits that I can relate with to Consuls are loving to be of service and keeping things clear, stable, and organised. 
I can agree I am conflict-averse, organised, and practical. Although there are traits that I do disagree with such as being inflexible and vulnerable to criticism. 
I also agree with being practical, conservative, and technical problem solving as opposed to imaginative and experimental. 
I am also conscientious, disciplined, efficient, well organised and have a strong sense of duty.</p>  
<p><h6>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?<h6>Workplace habits that Consuls have are patience, efficient and hardworking. However, Consuls can struggle with too much freedom and improvisation. 
Understanding this will keep me mindful that others are not always as routine and structured and to continue being supportive and effective when things are still not on track. 
The results of the Big Five test reveal that I am outgoing, friendly and like working with others. 
I am also relaxed, resilient and calm which can keep the team grounded in tough situations.</p> 
<p><h6>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h6> Being more extraverted than introverted, I am open to forming teams with all different types of people. 
Understanding our personalities will definitely encourage me to use my strengths when working in teams.</p>
<body>
<p><h2>Project Ideas</h2></p>
<p><h6>Overview</h6></p>
<p>The project will involve building a FAQ bot that involves speech-to-text and text-to-speech software.</p>
<p><h6>Motivation:</h6>In my current job, majority of IT support is located overseas with only hardware IT support situated locally. 
After the recent implementation of a new ERP system, there have been many issues and gaps of how to utilise the tool for end users. 
With the effects of Covid and limited resources, getting any IT support has been difficult, and responses could take up to 4 weeks.</p> 
<p><h6>Description of the features of the product or service:</h6>Developing a FAQ bot could potentially answer some frequently asked questions that have simple answers. 
The bot could also potentially organise any urgent issues that must be prioritized. The tool would be utilised to resolve simple issues and eliminate pressure to our limited resources. 
This will aim to improve productivity and response times.</p>
<p><h6>Tools and technologies:</h6>FAQ bots can be created through open-source tools such as Microsoft Teams and Tidio. These user-friendly software make creating FAQ bots easy for users with little IT knowledge.</p>
<p><h6>Outcome:</h6>If the project is successful, this should reduce the number of open IT related queries and reduce the pressure to our IT team. The development should also help educate end users on commonly asked IT queries.</p>
